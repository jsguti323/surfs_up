# Surfs Up!
## Overview
I am working with W. Avy to convince him that a ice cream / surf shop in Oahu, HI is a worthwhile investment. W. Avy is interested, but he has some concerns regarding how profitable a shop of this nature can be year round. Avy's main concern is how the weather in Oahu mayu impact my store's success. So, W. Avy has a requested a statistical analysis of the weather in Oahu, specifically in the months of June and December.

## Results

* June has a higher mean temperature than December
* December has a slightly highder StDev, thus it's weather fluctuates a little more.
* Both months nearly have the same max temperature, but December's minimum temperature is almost 10 degrees less than June's.
